S. Called 'Subversive': 'DEROGATORY' FILE O1. WASHINGTON, March 2— Three hundred eighty-three persons were included today in a broadly defined “subversive” category among 2,427 security risk separations from Government employment during the final seven months of 1953.</br></br>. Philip Young, chairman of the Civil Service\" Commission, explained to a Senate committee, however, that he could not say any or all of the 383 were either Communists or subversive^.</br></br>He\" said they had “derogatory material of a substantial nature” in their personnel files. But he could not say whether allegations of subversive association had been a controlling factor in their separation from Government.</br></br>He did not know how many had been dismissed, how many had resigned, or how many had received written notice that such “subversive” allegations were on file against them.</br></br>Democratic Senators said that at future hearings they would ask Mr. Young if there had been any investigation or considered evaluation whether the allegations of \"subversive’* associations in the files of the 383 persons were true or false. This issue was not raised today.   \n",

Prices of Treasury securities were essentially unchanged on nearly nonexistent volume yesterday, as credit market participants curbed buying and selling until after May employment data are released this morning.</br></br>“The past two days have been hid-eous,’’ one Government securities trader said. “For the most part, people are washed out and waiting for Friday.”</br></br>A rise in weekly initial unemployment claims, the first in three weeks, and sluggish chain-store sales reported for May did not have much impact on prices yesterday. Nor did money supply data that were weaker than expected.</br></br>“The recovery continues to look slow and anemic,” the trader said. “Until and unless that view changes, the market will pretty much sit where it is.”</br></br>Analysts noted that the number of individuals receiving unemployment benefits fell during the week ended May 23. The decline raises the possibility that the unemployment rate, which stood at 7.2 percent in April, could show a decline when the data are released.   \n",

WASHINGTON , Oct. 21Labor and civil rights forces won a crucial test today as a Senate committee voted to give the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission broad authority to combat job discrimination.</br></br>The committee approved a bill to give the commissioncreated' in 1964 but left without enforcement powers—the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders against discrimination in employment by either industry or labor unions. The bill would also broaden the commission’s jurisdiction.</br></br>Approval of the bill, by a surprising unanimous vote of 17 to 0, was a major rebuff for the Nixon Administration, which has openly backed a far less sweeping measure.</br></br>Despite the Administration stand, all seven Republicans on the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee joined the panel’s 10 Democrats in sending the broader bill to the Senate floor.</br></br>With such strong backing by the committee, it appears virtually certain that the Senate will approve the bill by a wide margin within the next few weeks.   \n",
      "2998  FARMERS PUNISHED IN WETBACK' DRIVE: SOME PERMITS TO USE MEXICANS ... HOLLYWOOD, Calif, May 26— Federal officials have made a small but noteworthy start to check the employment on Southwestern farms of wetback Mexican nationals who have illegally filtered across the 1,600-mile international boundary from the Pacific Coast to the mouth of the Rio Grande.</br></br>The United States Employment Service’s regional office in San Francisco reported this week that in the initial phase of a ‘‘gettough’’ campaign, it had taken sanctions against a dozen ranch operators in the Imperial and Coachella Valleys of southern California.</br></br>These sanctions consisted of revoking the ranchers’ permits to hire Mexican nationals on contract for six-month periods under an agreement by the United States and Mexico to supplement the domestic farm-labor supply.</br></br>One provision of the agreement is that no employer of legal Mexican contract labor shall employ wetbacks, who, because of their illegal entry into the United States and fear of deportation, work for near-starvation wages.</br></br>However, since upwards of one million wetbacks, according to reliable estimates, filter into the Southwest annually, their employment has been widespread, even on ranches hiring Mexican contract workers legally. This “mixed crew” violation of the international agreement generally has been winked at.   \n",

Prospects are looking up for the employment of highly paid execqtives, a study among leading search firms showed yesterday, The hiring outlook for 1973 appears to be more optimistic than at any time in the last five years, although there were some reservations ex-1 pressed regarding the employment of college graduates look-| ing for their first post in commerce and industry.</br></br>Boyden Associates, one of the leading executive search firms in the country, predicted that the demand for executives with minimum salaries of $25,000 will increase about 11 per cent in 1973 from the 1972 figure.</br></br>Frederick M. Linton, president of Boyden, said that the demand would probably rise well over 11 per cent. This conclusion was reached in a nationwide survey of 475 major corporations by the company.</br></br>Apparently, according to the survey, the greatest demand will be in the 30 to 45-year-old age bracket. Executives most sought, it was said, are those who have had some general management responsibility, and who have changed jobs two or three times.</br></br>A prerequisite frequenty expressed was that executives in greatest demand are those who are “outgoing, forthright, willing to work hard and make personal sacrifices.”\\tj   \n",

The Dow lost 170 points   \n",
      "381     Freakoutonomics. E month saw one of the sharpest drops in consumer confidence since the recessions of 1979-1982. But those were truly dreadful times. Oil prices tripled, rates on home mortgages shot into the mid-teens, the stock market was a disaster area and unemployment rates reached double digits.</br></br>Over the past three years, by contrast, American economic performance has been almost glittering. Inflation is stiil low, while employment and productivity have all been rising strongly. True, stock markets are clearly nervous, and the sharp upsurge in gas prices is adding to con- sumer skittishness. But the reaction still seems inconsistent with the economy’s underlying strengths.</br></br>There arc parallels with another historical period, however, that suggest the deeper currents of uneasiness.</br></br>Pan the camera back to Pittsburgh, July 1877. The Pennsylvania Railroad yard, stretching along the city’s riverfront, is a raging inferno, set afire by angry mobs of railroad workers. A contingent of state militiamen, trapped in a burning railroad roundhouse, fight their way through the flames with a Gatling gun.</br></br>Over the next few weeks riots rage throughout the country. In Chicago, newspaper headlines declare that “howling mobs\" control the city. In New York, The Sun demands a “diet of lead\" for rioters. Unrest in San Francisco explodes into a vicious anti-Chinese pogrom. The same period marks the glory years of the rural Granger movement and the Roman-candle growth of the Knights of Labor. American Populism puts down permanent roots.   \n",
